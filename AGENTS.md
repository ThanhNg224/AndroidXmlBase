## Mission

This file defines how AI assistants should contribute to any Android project. Contributions must prioritize maintainability, consistency, adherence to Clean Architecture principles, and long-term code quality.

---

## Current Project Phase (AndroidXmlBase)

This repository is currently in the **base-building phase**: hardening the reusable `core/` foundation itself, not building a feature on top of it. While in this phase, proactively adding modern, production-grade infrastructure to `core/` (startup correctness, security posture, logging, performance tooling) is expected even before a concrete consuming feature demands it — the whole point of a base is to be a solid foundation for every future feature, and gaps are expensive to retrofit later.

This is a narrow, scoped exception to the "no abstraction without proven reuse" principles elsewhere in this document. It does not license new Gradle modules, feature-specific abstractions, or anything that isn't genuinely foundational. Once feature development on top of this base begins, the rules below apply again in full.

---

## Engineering Documents

This repository is governed by multiple engineering documents. Every implementation must follow all relevant documents instead of relying on a single source.

| Document | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| AGENTS.md | AI workflow, engineering mindset, implementation strategy, decision making and review process. |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | Clean Architecture, MVVM responsibilities, dependency rules, feature boundaries, module organization, repository patterns and data flow. |
| STANDARD.md | Kotlin coding conventions, Android best practices, naming, formatting, implementation standards and code quality. |
| GIT_FLOW.md | Branching strategy, commit conventions, pull request workflow and collaboration guidelines. |

Treat these documents as the project's engineering source of truth.

## Core Engineering Principles

- Understand before implementing.
- Reuse before creating.
- Consistency over perfection.
- Simplicity over cleverness.
- Readability over brevity.
- Refactor only when valuable.
- Prefer extending existing implementations.
- Never optimize without evidence.

---

## AI Workflow

For every request:

1. Understand the user's intent.
2. Identify which engineering documents are relevant.
3. Read the relevant documents before making architectural or implementation decisions.
4. Explore the existing implementation.
5. Search for similar implementations.
6. Reuse existing patterns whenever possible.
7. Implement the smallest complete solution.
8. Perform a self-review before responding.

Never start implementing immediately after reading a request. Understanding the project always comes before writing code.

---

## Selecting the Right Guideline

Need implementation strategy or AI behavior?  
→ AGENTS.md

Need architectural decisions?  
→ ARCHITECTURE.md

Need coding conventions or Kotlin guidelines?  
→ STANDARD.md

Need branching, commits or pull request workflow?  
→ GIT_FLOW.md

When multiple documents apply, consult every relevant document before implementing.

---

## Implementation Decision Tree

Before creating any new implementation, evaluate the following in order:

1. Does an implementation already exist?
   → Reuse it.
2. Does a similar implementation exist?
   → Extend or adapt it.
3. Is the solution reusable across multiple features?
   → Move it to Shared/Core.
4. Is it only needed by one feature?
   → Keep it inside that feature.
5. Does it introduce a new architectural decision?
   → Verify against ARCHITECTURE.md.
6. Does it follow the project's coding standards?
   → Verify against STANDARD.md.
7. Will it affect collaboration or Git history?
   → Verify against GIT_FLOW.md.

Only create a completely new implementation after the previous options have been evaluated.

## Decision Priority

1. Existing implementation  
2. Shared reusable component  
3. Extend existing implementation  
4. Small refactor  
5. New implementation  
6. New abstraction  

---

## Before Creating Anything

Before creating a new Activity, Fragment, Composable, ViewModel, UseCase, Repository, Mapper, Adapter, Helper, Extension, Utility, Dialog, or Custom View, AI must verify whether one already exists.

---

## Clean Architecture Rules

- Respect architectural boundaries.  
- Dependencies point inward.  
- UI contains presentation logic only.  
- Domain contains business rules.  
- Data handles persistence and networking.  
- Never bypass layers.  
- Never place business logic inside UI.  

Project-specific architecture details belong in ARCHITECTURE.md.

---

## Feature Development

- Match existing feature structure.  
- Reuse existing navigation and state management patterns.  
- Keep feature boundaries clear.  
- Avoid introducing project-wide abstractions unless multiple features require them.

---

## Code Quality

- Write small, focused functions.  
- Use meaningful names.  
- Prefer immutable state when practical.  
- Use early returns to reduce nesting.  
- Remove dead code.  
- Avoid magic numbers.  
- Avoid nested complexity.  
- Prefer composition over inheritance.  
- Keep code easy to review.

---

## Refactoring Guidelines

- Refactor with clear purpose.  
- Avoid unrelated cleanup.  
- Preserve existing behavior.  
- Keep commits focused.  
- Large rewrites require explicit request.

---

## Communication

- Ask instead of guessing.  
- Explain trade-offs.  
- Mention architectural impacts.  
- Highlight assumptions.

---

## Never Do

- Duplicate business logic.  
- Bypass architecture.  
- Mix UI and business logic.  
- Create Manager/Helper/Util dumping classes.  
- Add abstractions without real reuse.  
- Rewrite unrelated files.  
- Introduce breaking changes silently.  
- Ignore existing conventions.

---

## Definition of Done

- Existing patterns reused.  
- Architecture respected.  
- Naming consistent.  
- Minimal implementation.  
- No duplicated logic.  
- No dead code.  
- No debug leftovers.  
- Self-reviewed.

---

## Repository Exploration

Before implementing, inspect the repository in this order:

1. Similar feature.
2. Shared/Core module.
3. Existing architecture pattern.
4. Existing utilities or extensions.

Never assume something does not exist until you have searched for it.

---

## Pattern Matching

New code should match the existing project.

Reuse existing:
- Structure
- Naming
- Dependency Injection
- State management
- Navigation
- Error handling
- Repository pattern

Consistency is preferred over introducing a different style.

---

## Kotlin Best Practices

- Prefer immutable objects.
- Prefer val over var.
- Keep extension functions focused.
- Avoid giant utility files.
- Use sealed classes where state is finite.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Keep coroutine scopes explicit.
- Never use GlobalScope.
- Avoid nullable types unless necessary.
- Fail early whenever possible.

---

## Android Best Practices

- Keep Activities and Fragments lightweight.
- ViewModels own presentation logic.
- Business logic belongs in the Domain layer.
- Data layer owns networking and persistence.
- UI should react to state instead of controlling business logic.
- Avoid leaking Android framework classes into business logic.

---

## Performance Guidelines

Only optimize code when there is measurable evidence.

Do not sacrifice readability for micro-optimizations.

Avoid unnecessary allocations, excessive recomposition, repeated database queries, and duplicated network requests.

---

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid introducing:

- God classes
- Massive ViewModels
- Manager classes with unrelated responsibilities
- Helper or Util classes containing random logic
- Circular dependencies
- Deep inheritance hierarchies
- Copy-paste implementations
- Feature-specific code inside shared modules
- Shared modules depending on feature modules

---

## Definition of Good Code

Good code is:

- Easy to understand.
- Easy to modify.
- Easy to test.
- Easy to review.
- Predictable.
- Consistent.
- Loosely coupled.
- Highly cohesive.

Readable code is preferred over clever code.

---

## AI Response Expectations

When responding:

- Explain significant architectural decisions only when relevant.
- Mention trade-offs when multiple valid solutions exist.
- Recommend reuse before creating new implementations.
- Keep explanations concise and actionable.

---

---

## Cross-Reference Requirement

AI must never make architectural or implementation decisions using only one engineering document.

Before implementing any change:

- Cross-reference AGENTS.md for workflow and decision making.
- Cross-reference ARCHITECTURE.md for architecture and dependency rules.
- Cross-reference STANDARD.md for coding conventions and implementation details.
- Cross-reference GIT_FLOW.md for collaboration workflow.

If an implementation conflicts with another engineering document, stop and resolve the conflict instead of guessing.

## Guiding Principle

The primary objective is not to produce code quickly.

The primary objective is to produce code that naturally fits into the existing project, is easy for other developers to understand, and remains maintainable over time.

When in doubt, choose the solution that minimizes long-term maintenance cost rather than the one that introduces the newest or most sophisticated technique.

---

## Code Review Mindset

Every implementation should be reviewed before being considered complete.

Review in the following order:

1. Correctness
2. Architecture
3. Reusability
4. Readability
5. Simplicity
6. Performance
7. Maintainability

If a problem can be prevented during review, fix it before delivering the final solution.

---

## Refactoring Triggers

Refactor only when one or more of the following is true:

- Business logic is duplicated.
- Responsibilities are unclear.
- The implementation is difficult to understand.
- Existing architecture is violated.
- Multiple files implement the same concept differently.
- A reusable pattern has clearly emerged.

Do not refactor simply because a different style is preferred.

---

## Architecture Smells

Watch for these warning signs:

- UI performing business decisions.
- ViewModels directly accessing APIs or databases.
- Domain depending on Android framework classes.
- Data layer exposing implementation details.
- Circular feature dependencies.
- Large classes with multiple unrelated responsibilities.
- Excessive inheritance.
- Utility classes becoming dumping grounds.

Whenever possible, improve these incrementally instead of rewriting entire features.

---

## Handling Existing Code

Existing code is part of the project history.

Unless explicitly requested:

- Preserve public APIs.
- Preserve behavior.
- Minimize breaking changes.
- Minimize file churn.
- Keep diffs focused.

Prefer evolutionary improvements over complete rewrites.

---

## Handling New Features

For new features:

- Follow the project's established feature structure.
- Keep dependencies isolated.
- Prefer existing UI components.
- Introduce new abstractions only after repeated need.
- Design for maintainability instead of maximum flexibility.

---

## Prompt Interpretation

Before implementing, determine whether the request is asking to:

- Fix an existing implementation.
- Extend existing behavior.
- Refactor existing code.
- Introduce a new feature.
- Improve performance.
- Improve readability.
- Explain existing code.

Do not assume a rewrite is expected when a small change satisfies the request.

---

## Engineering Mindset

Good engineering is measured by how easily future developers can understand and extend the code.

Every decision should reduce future maintenance cost, preserve architectural consistency, and improve long-term sustainability.

If multiple solutions are technically correct, choose the one that best fits the existing project rather than the most sophisticated implementation.

---

## Rule Priority

When multiple rules apply, follow this priority:

1. Explicit user requirements.
2. AGENTS.md
3. ARCHITECTURE.md
4. STANDARD.md
5. GIT_FLOW.md
6. Existing project conventions.

If rules conflict and the correct decision cannot be determined, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.

---

## Guiding Rule

If a solution is technically correct but inconsistent with the existing project, prefer consistency unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
